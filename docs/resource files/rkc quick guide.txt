The A320 Family Aircrafts having No Fault Found Policy (NFF)

The aircraft is equipped with a high number of digital items of equipment. In most
of the cases, computers may be recovered after an abnormal behaviour ora
detected fault, either by a software reset (reset of microprocessor) or by
interrupting the power supply of its processing parts for a short time. T

achieved with the normal cockpit controls (engagement levers, pushbutton
switches) by selecting the related control off then on or by action on the
corresponding circuit breaker.

The A320 Family maintenance concept is based on the use of the Centralised Fault
Display System (CFDS) and the Troubleshooting Manual (TSM).

The main purpose of the CFDS is to ease aircraft maintenance by compiling
failure information from system BITE (Built-In Test Equipment) and providing
system BITE test capability from the cockpit.

Built-In Test Equipment (BITE)

The CFDS also takes into account a major objective of the line maintenance which
is to avoid unjustified removals of equipment. For these reasons the CFDS makes
a detailed analysis to identify the responsible LRUs; this is also to confirm that the
event was actually due to a hardware failure and not an intermittent fault. To
achieve its purpose, the CFDS has several major functions which supply:-A
maintenance Post Flight Report (PFR) which is printed at the end of each flight.

Failure Classification & Indication:- The CFDIU generates its flight/ground
condition using some parameters transmitted by the Flight Warning Computer
(FWC), the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC), the memorised maintenance
phases and a discrete signal from the Landing Gear Control and Interface U
(LGCIU).
¢ In normal operation, t phase information is transmitted by the FWCs to the
CFDIU and when a new flight number is entered the information is given by the
FAC.Failure Reporting per flight phase

Failure Classification
The maintenance message classification is based on fault consequences on flight
operations:
° Class 1 faults may have an operational consequence on flight
° Class 2 faults have no immediate operational consequence on flight
¢ Class 3 faults have no consequence on flight.
Trouble Shooting of Faults Reported on the PFR
The following general procedure describes trouble shooting of Upper ECAM DU
warnings, ECAM STS (Status) Maintenance messages or CFDS fault messages given
on the PFR.

This Q.R. Guide is for Reference only.
Refer current Air-N@v AMM/TSM Prepared by R.K.CHOPRA

 
 

(1) Compare the ECAM warning or ECAM STS message with the CFDS fault

message (if applicable) on the PFR to obtain the fault symptom and the ATA

chapter reference. A time difference of 1-3 minutes between the fault message
and the warning message may occur due to CFDIU internal behaviour.

(2) Use the Trouble Shooting function to retrieve the fault symptom, correlate the
CFDS message and retrieve the associated fault isolation procedure.

For further fault isolation use the source (SOURCE column) and/or CFDS fault
message identifiers (IDENT block). Due to the number of possible identifier, the
fault message identifier in the TSM must be the same as on the PFR.

ECAM display:-Display :Maintenance Status are only displayed in flight phases 1
and 10 (i.e. engine not running). It means that when one system sends a
maintenance status to be displayed, the FWC will delay it until flight phase 10
pending the system keeps on sending the fault. But the alert will be reported in
the PFR at the time when the maintenance status has been computed for

Maintenance action.

CENTRALIZED FAULT DISPLAY SYSTEM

               

 

BITE:-Troubleshooting via MCDU
PER:- The POST FLIGHT REPORT, which is part of the main maintenance menu,
associates all the ECAM warnings (primary and independent) and the fault

messages (class 1 and 2) of the last flight, given information concerning the failed
LRU if the faulty message is not sufficiently precise. The correlation between the
fault messages and the ECAM warnings is done by GMT time stamp comparison.

This item is the “sum” of LAST LEG REPORT and LAST LEG ECAM REPORT items.
These messages are separated into two parts; the first part contains the ECAM
warnings associated with the time, the flight phase and the ATA reference, the
second contains the failed LRUs associated with the time, the ATA reference and
the identifiers. Aircraft identification, the date, the flight time, the flight number
(airline) and the departure and arrival airports are included in the header.

The following data are recorded in the PFR:

* ECAM WARNING MESSAGES:-The ECAM WARNING MESSAGES contains::- the
warning message available on the upper ECAM display unit & the maintenance
status These warning messages are associated with their ATA reference (aid for
cross referencing with the maintenance message).FAULTS: Maintenance
messages are listed in the PFR in the FAILURE MESSAGES part. Additional
informatidn is associated with each message.

- FLIGHT PHASE — GMT Flight operational phases (CLIMB, CRUISE, etc.) are
indicated in coded form in the PFR in front of the warning message. The time
(GMT) is also given in front of the warning message and the maintenance
message.

AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM CONTROLLER
The Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU) is only connected to the
ACSC 2. All BITE data of ACSC 1 will be transmitted to ACSC 2 first before it goes
to the CFDIU.
Air Conditioning System Controller:-The ACSC is a 2 lane, fully redundant
computer system with independent central, processing units and duplicated
hardware interfaces. One lane is active while the other lane is passive (“hot-
standby”). If the active lane is not able to control the system, the passive lane will
become active and take over system control.
The active lane switches at each aircraft landing, assuming the passive lane has
no faults which are more severe than those in the active lane.
ACSC1 and ACSC2 have different functions. Functional differences between the
two controllers are determined by pin programming after installation in the
aircraft.
ACSC1:- control of F/D zones, trim system and trim air pressure relief valve,; wing
and nacelle anti ice logic.
ACSC2:-control of cabin zones and trim system,; CFDS interface and fault storage,
wing anti ice fault analysis, mixer flap drive and monitoring.
FLOW CONTROL UNIT:-Each FCU includes the FCV, 2 solenoids, one torque motor,
one position sensor and 2 pressure sensors. The FCU operates in MAIN or BACK-
UP mode, controlled by the ACSC through the solenoids. The functions of the
components are:- Solenoid 1 controls the ON/OFF (isolation) function. When this
solenoid is energized, the FCV is open and regulates when bleed air pressure is
available.-Solenoid 2 controls the MAIN or BACK-UP operation. When this
solenoid is de-energized, the FCV operates in MAIN mode. The solenoid
is energized for BACK-UP operation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PRESSOR DISCHARGE TEMPERATURE SENSOR:- The compressor discharge

1) com
temperature sensor signals the compressor outlet temperature to the ACSC for

pack temperature control and overheat detec :
Pack temperature control: - up to 180°C normal operation,
- 180°C to 220°C:- the ram air inlet flap opens more in order to increase the RAM

airflow. The pack FAULT light comes on in if there is pack overheat of 260°C. If the

A/C is on ground, automatic FCV closure occurs.
2) WATER EXTRACT TEMPERATURE SENSOR;-The water extract temperature
sensor signals the water extractor temperature for the pack outlet temperature
control. The pack temperature sensor has two thermistors: one sensing element is
connected to lane 1 and the other to lane 2 of the related ACSC. They are used to
modulate the pack outlet temperature.

3) PACK DISCHARGE TEMPERATURE SENSOR:-The pack discharge temperature
sensor signals the pack outlet temperature to the ACSC for ECAM display. The pack
outlet temperature sensor also gives pack overheat warning indications if the pack

outlet temperature exceeds 88°C.

  

> When Fault as AIR PACK 1 or 2 OVERHEAT" warning
FLOW PASSING through the Flow Control Valve is given by the Differential
Pressure Sensor and the Pack Inlet Pressure Sensor. Adrift between the
information given by the Differential Pressure Sensor and the Pack
Inlet Pressure Sensor could result in high flow regulation of the Flow Control
Valve.
This higher flow leading to the ACM fan running faster, in prevention as soon as
the Compressor Discharge Temperature (CDS) Increases above 180°C, the Air
Conditioning System Controller (ACSC) then commands the Ram Air Door in open
position. If opening of the Ram Air Door is not sufficient to decrease the
compressor outlet temperature, when the CDS increases above 215°C, the Flow
Control Valve starts to close, controlled by the ACSC. When the temperature
becomes higher than 260°C, an AIR PACK 1 or 2 OVHT ECAM warning is triggered.
On ground, the Flow Control Valve is automatically switched off

Please confirm ACM overheat occur due faults out of ACSC control.
The water extractor crack had resulted in Pack Overheat
> The ACSC (or Pack Controller) only monitors the ACM compressor and

turbine outlet temperatures to detect a possible overheating pack.
Damaged pack supply sleeves or ACM hoses would not be detected by the ACSC
unless high temperature is detected at ACM compressor or turbine outlets.

The Pack Outlet Temperature demand computed by the ACSCs is transmitted to
the packs. To reach the temperature target the ACSCs control the Ram Air Inlet
doors and the BPVs. The RAI doors regulate the cooling flow of the heat
exchangers. On ground they should be more open than in flight except during the
take-off & landing phases where they close up to prevent contamination.

The BPV control by the ACSC is automatic and this By-Pass Valve has an impact
on the pack permeability. The more the BPV opens up the less air flows through
the ACM which tends to lower its speed hence the pack air flow. In addition to
having a de-icing function at turbine outlet, the BPV aims to adjust the Pack
Outlet Temperature.

In summary, for maximum cooling, the RAI doors are fully open and the BPV is
fully closed. For maximum heating, the RAI doors are nearly closed and BPV is
fully open. Eventually, an overheating pack can be caused by ice accretion in the
ACM turbine due to a failed Water Extractor (WE). Ice particles can be found in the
turbine if the WE is not ensuring its function anymore. In this case the ACM can
be found to be overheating.

> Pack Performance Quick Check
The A320 air conditioning pack incorporates 3 heat exchangers that are
susceptible to contamination and may therefore affect the pack outlet
temperature. Present system monitoring is such that it does not facilitate
identification of Environmental Control System (ECS) components which are
affected by contamination and therefore can have an impact on the cooling
capability. Three parameters are displayed on the ECAM BLEED page, and can be
monitored via the MCDU these being pack flow, pack outlet temperature and
compressor outlet temperature. Therefore in the case of high pack discharge
temperature being reported on ground (higher than 10 degree Celsius (10°C) with
full cold selected in all zones) ,
it is recommended to refer with regards to pack performance on ground it is
recommended to refer to trouble shooting manual

CABIN PRESSURE CONTROLLERS
There are two interchangeable controllers, which are identified as Cabin
Pressure Controller (CPC) 1 and CPC 2 by means of pin programming.
Each controller has an automatic and manual part which are functionally
and electronically independent of each other. One controller operates the
system at a time according to flight profile data and A/C configurations.
The second controller is in active stand-by with automatic changeover
after each flight_or in case of failure of the active one.

CPC Auto Transfer:-At every flight, 70 seconds after touchdown, the CPC in
control (MASTER MODE) during the flight will switch in STANDBY MODE and the
CPC in STANDBY MODE during the flight will switch in MASTER MODE.

However, the auto transfer will also take place if a failure is detected on the CPC
in control. Therefore, the CPC in control will switch in STANDBY MODE and the
CPC in STANDBY MODE will switch in MASTER MODE.

CABIN ALTITUDE INDICATION AUTO MODE:- The calculation of the cabin altitude
in the AUTO mode is done differently in relation to the aircraft altitude:

- If the aircraft altitude is higher than 5000 ft above take-off or landing

fields, the cabin altitude is calculated to the standard atmosphere.

- If the aircraft altitude is lower than 5000 ft above take-off or landing

fields, the cabin altitude is calculated to the true altitude above sea

level with the barometric correction from the Air Data Inertial
Reference System (ADIRS)..

are: FWC and SDAC. CPC 2 manual part is not used.
SAFETY VALVES:-The safety valves prevent excessive positive and negative
differential pressure (DELTA P) in the fuselage. They are installed on the aft
pressure bulkhead above the A/C flotation line. The safety valves are poppet-type
pneumatic valves. They operate independently.
RPCU:-The RPCU interfaces with the CPCs and takes over the control of the
outflow valves automatically if the outflow valve is not in the fully open

position when the aircraft is on ground. This is to prevent any door violent
opening in case of residual cabin pressure.

mnily active in FAC 1.

FIDS is a card physically located in each FAC. Both FACs are
interchangeable, but only the FAC 1 FIDS is active due to the side 1
signal... .
EAC BITE:-As the FAC and FG have a BITE in the CMD and the MONitor
(MON) sides, the fault analysis is generally made on each side and a synthesis
is made on the CMD side. Each BITE memorizes the result of the analysis,
the failure context, the flight leg number, the time and date of each given
failure. Then the BITE sends the result of the analysis, with a maximum
of two suspected LRUs in the order of probability, to the FIDS.
FCU BITE:-Each FCU BITE computes the maintenance status of its related part and
permanently sends this maintenance data to the FG CMD part.

> Monitoring of FAC
FAC monitors the following devices for correct operation. The engagement status
of the pushbuttons for the YD, RT, and RTLs Internal monitoring of the computer,
acquisition channel, transmission and software (FAC healthy).
Monitoring of specific failures in transmission and reception of FMGC and ELAC.
Monitoring of sensors (LVDT and RVDT). Monitoring of the peripherals ADRIS,
LGCIU and SFCC.
The safety test automatically tests for the correct operation of digital devices and
safety devices. It is activated on ground only when engines are shut down.
Done after every power cut off (> 4 seconds) and lasts for a maximum of a
minute. If the safety test is passed then only the FAC can be engaged.

> When Fault Message as: Pitch Trim/MCDU/CG disagree:
In the frame of "take off securing", a Pitch Trim/MCDU/Center of Gravity (CG)
disagree caution is implemented in FAC, computes a theoretical Trimmable
Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) position using the MCDU CG. This theoretical position is
sent to the FWC which compares it with the actual THS position. In case of
discrepancy (threshold defined in FWC logics) the
“pitch trim / MCDU / CG disagree" alert is triggered.
Purpose of this project was to increase reliability of CG input in FMS, THS setting at
take-off and reduce the rate of events due to erroneous entries. The real pitch trim
value, The pitch trim value calculated by the FAC, based on the CG, The pitch trim
value entered in the MCDU.
. A failure of one system is unlikely at the origin of the alert. Therefore there is no

—q The line maintenance of the Automatic Flight System (AFS) is based on the use of
the Fault Isolation and Detection System (FIDS). The system:

- detects, isolates and stores the AFS internal and external faults,

es - initiates and performs the test after replacement of an AFS LRU,
initiates and performs the availability test of the category !!I automatic landing

function
FIDS : The FIDS will only accept the test request if its ground condition is met

(NOSE GEAR PRESSED).
- LRUs UNDER TEST : The LRUs under test will only accept the test request if their
a own ground conditions are met (NOSE GEAR PRESSED AND ENGINES STOPPED).

- AFIDS card physically located in each Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC), only
the card located in the FAC1 is activated (by the SIDE 1 signal)

AUTOTHRUST FUNCTION:-The A/THR function sends a computed thrust command
(thrust target) to the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) for automatic
engine control. The A/THR functions are:

- acquisition and holding of a speed or a Mach number,

- acquisition and holding of a thrust,

- reduction of the thrust to idle during descent and flare in final approach,

- protection against excessive Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) called alpha-floor

protection, by ordering a maximum thrust when an alpha-floor detection

signal is received from the Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs).

AUTOTHRUST LOOP PRINCIPLE:-To get the A/THR function, the thrust target
computed by the Flight Management and Guidance Computers (FMGCs) is chosen
by the Flight Control Unit (FCU). Then each FCU processor sends, along its own
bus, the thrust target to the FADEC via the Engine Interface Units (ElUs).

A/THR pb:-The flight crew uses this pushbutton to arm, activate, or disconnect the
auto thrust (A/THR). This button illuminates green if the A/THR is armed or active.

> WIND SHEAR DETECTION
Wind shear is a sudden change of wind velocity / speed over a relatively Shorter
distance in atmosphere.

This can have an adverse effect on aircraft’s performance, during t/o and landing
phases. FACS generate the wind Shear warning, whenever the energy level of the
aircraft falls below a predetermined threshold. No sensor is available to detect
wind shear.

There are two types of wind shear detection systems, reactive and predictive.
The reactive wind shear system react to the aircraft being in wind shear and the
predictive system, such as weather radar, looks ahead to predict a wind shear.
When encountering a wind shear, on final approach, the AIRCRFAT first enters an
increasing headwind and updraft.

The pilot may react by reducing power to bring the aircraft back down.

But, next the aircraft enters an area of severe downdraft followed by increasing
tailwind. At this point, it may be too late to develop the thrust required to escape
before sinking to ground. ( Request watch U tube Video)

CIDS DIRECTOR:-For redundancy, the system has two identical directors.

In normal operation, director 1 is active and director 2 is in hot stand-by.
This means that director 2 receives and computes the same data as director 1
but its outputs are disabled.

The director commands cabin equipment via DEUs. The cargo smoke system
is linked by Controller Area Network (CAN) busses. The FAP is linked by
Ethernet busses. Each director is separated in two parts:

- The director main functions with the integrated Vacuum System Control
Function (VSCF).:-The smoke detection board.

In the emergency mode, only the essential bus supplies 28VDC to the CID

> When jacking the aircraft it might be necessary to communicate between

personnel at various points around the aircraft. Once the weight off
wheels, the service interphone system is disabled due to the logic of the
system. The Landing Gear Control and Interface Unit (LGCIU) on ground
discrete disables all service interphone connections.

The reason for this is to stop potential static noise started and amplified
through the AMU due to the length of wires acting as antenna, into the
audio system. To re-enable the service interphone, the service interphone

override P/BSW must be switched to 'ON'. The Service Interphone Override switch

is on the Maintenance Panel 50VU on the overhead in the cockpit.

The electrical power system consists of a three-phase 115/200 V 400 Hz constant-
frequency AC system and a 28 V DC system. Electrical transients are acceptable for
equipment. Commercial supply has secondary priority.

 

In normal configuration, the electrical power system provides AC power. The
electrical power system is constituted of 2 engine generators and -
generator. Each generator can provide AC power to all electrical bus b:
of this AC power is conver into DC power for certain applications.
In the event that normal AC power is not available, an emergency generator can
provide AC power. In the event that all AC power is not available, the electrical
power system can invert DC power from the batteries into AC power.
The main functions for the regulation and protection of the IDG are:
- regulation of the generator voltage at Point Of Regulation (POR),

- regulation of the generator speed,

+ monitoring and protection of the system.

NOTE: With engine stopped, the DG cannot be disconnected. An under speed
condition inhibits the disconnection.

The Ground and Auxiliary Power Control Unit (GAPCU) is the interface
between the Generator Control Unit (GCU) 1 and 2 and the Centralized Fault
display Interface Unit (CFDIU).

GCU/GAPCU:-The GAPCU receives the fault information from GCU 1 and 2, and
compiles them with its own failures and transmits them to the CFDIU.
GAPCU/CFDIU:-The maintenance test can be performed only on ground with
engine shut down. It is initiated either:

- Automatically at each GAPCU power-up. Or manually from the MCDU.
SYSTEM TEST:- The system test is done on the ground, with the GAPCU in the
interactive mode. Only internal GAPCU and GCU tests are done. The first test page
asks for confirmation that engines and APU are not running. The test displays the
GAPCU and each GCU test results. In the example the GAPCU has passed, GCU 1
test did not run and GCU 2 has failed. A test will not run if the related engine or
APU is running. More information about the failed test (GCU 2) is available by
selecting the line keys. Selecting the CLASS 1 line key gives snapshot
troubleshooting data.

PURPOSE OF THE AC/DC ESS SHED bus is to cut off certain feeders (who would
normally feed off the AC/DC ESS) from the AC/ESS bus for emergency purposes?
Better put, is the principle that:-( In A320 Shed Bus most essential bus) i.e.

FMGC 1, FAC1=DC ESS SHED BUS IVICDU 1=AC ESS SHED BUS.......... etc.

The AC/DC ESS bus are busses that ensure an electrical supply to only the most
important users during an electrical emergency. Then during an electrical
emergency these users may be further sub-divided with regards to importance as
there is not enough electrical supply for all the essential users, (hence a separate
bus is created allowing for the removal of less important users) therefore those
users attached to the AC/DC ESS SHED bus are cut off from the electrical supply
leaving those users on the AC/DC ESS having priority to the remaining electrical

supply.

 

 

 

 

 

CIRCUIT BREAKERS (C/BS):- The aircraft has two types of C/Bs: ;
- Monitored (green): When out for more than 1 min, the C/B TRIPPED warning is
triggered on the ECAM.

- Non-monitored (C/BS):- (black).

The Wing Tip Brake (WTB) C/Bs have red caps on them to prevent them from
being reset..

To clear the ECAM C/B TRIPPED caution by pressing: ;

- The EMER CANC pb:- When pressed, this pushbutton clears and inhibits the ECAM
C/B TRIPPED caution for the remainder of the flight, or

- The CLR pb:- When pressed, this pushbutton only clears the ECAM C/B TRIPPED

*LOOP FAULT WARNING:-In case of a loop failure the FDU supplies a loop fault
warning signal to the ECAM and Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU).
The FDU generates an inoperative signal if any of the following conditions are
met:- (a) electrical failure, (b) integrity failure, (c) detection of a single ioop FIRE
during more than 16 s while the other loop is in normal condition

ENGINE AND APU FIRE DETECTION:-The engines and the APU have individual fire
detection systems. Each system has two identical detection loops (A and B)
installed in parallel. Each loop includes 3 detector elements.

The two loops are monitored by a Fire Detection Unit (FDU).

FDU 1 monitors the loops on engine 1 and FDU 2 monitors the loops on

engine 2. The FDU sends FIRE and FAULT signals to the Flight Warning
Computer (FWC) for display on ECAM.

DETECTION FAULT WARNING:-The detection fault logic is based on a dual loop
failure. It agrees with a total loss of the detection system. When the FDU
generates two inoperative signals related to loop A and loop B fault logic, the
Flight Warning Computer (FWC) elaborates the fault warning.FIRE DETECTION
CIRCUIT:-The engine fire and overheat detection system is supplied by the
electrical Power from the DC system. Each engine has two continuous loops
cnnected in parallel to a Fire Detection Unit (FDU) Each FDU has two identical
channels: channel A and B. Each one has its own power supply and is connected
to one fire detection loop.

FIRE DETECTORS STATE:-
In NORMAL STATE, the INTEGRITY switch is closed and the ALARM switch is open.
In ALARM STATE: The effect of an average temperature expands the helium
(inert) gas, which in turn closes the ALARM switch,(which was open) or the effect
of heat caused by a flame or hot gas, releases core (active) gas from the hybrid
core, which in turn closes the ALARM switch.

In both cases, the detector sends a fire signal.
In FAULT STATE:-In the event of gas pressure loss (pipe fracture or cut off due to
a torching flame), the INTEGRITY switch opens (which was close) and generates a

fault signal.

the CFDS and indicates failed systems. This test includes:
- Restart of the Power Up test,
- Monitoring of input and output signals.On ground, SMOKE WARN TESTS can be
selected on the SDCU menu of the MCDU

If submenu Sit Wy is selected, a submenu with =. smoke

installed is displayed. A test for 2ach smoke detector can be selected by the line
key. During the test of the smoke detectors the ec DS channel
sends a test request to the lavatory smoke detector via the DEU 8 and
the CAN bi

If the smoke detector is operative it transmits a test-alarm information to

the DEU 8. The DEU B transmits the information to the CIDS-SDF via the
CIDS internal bus. The CIDS starts the cabin indications (chime, FAP, AIP,
ACP) and the CIDS- SDF sets the ARINC 429 outputs to the FWC.

SPECIFIC DATA:- If the key “SPECIFIC DATA” is pressed the system shall transmit
a ”SIMOKE WARNING REPORT” page. In case of smoke warning, if ”SIMOKE
WARNING REPORT” is pushed, the “SIMOKE WARNINGS REPORT” page layout
characteristics shall be identical to the PREVIOUS LEGS REPORT” except that:-

-The title displayed shall be “SIMOKE WARNINGS REPORT”,

-No failure “CLASS” shall be displayed, In case of a smoke warning during the last

WHEN APU AUTO EXTINGUISHING TEST:- should be performed This test will
insure that the APU will be protected in case of a fire. When a fire is detected the
APU will shut down and the fire bottle will be discharged automatically.

The Auto extinguishing test pushbutton is found on the overhead MAINT
panel. The test must be done with the APU shut down but with the master
switch selected ON. During the test the APU auto shutdown is simulated

and the APU fuel supply valve is closed.

Both squibs of each engine fire bottle No. 1 and one squ’s of the APU

fire bottle are supplied by 28 VDC from the HOT bus. When performing
maintenance with the FIRE pushbutton released out, make sure to pull

both squib C/Bs to protect against bottle discharge. If the C/Bs are not
pulled, the bottle may be discharged even without power on the aircraft.

ELECTRICAL FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM:-The Electrica! ‘ | Control System EFCS
includes the two ELAC’s, the three SEC's, two Flight Centret Seta Concentrators (
FCDC ) and four accelerometers.

 

 
  
   

The two ELAC’s are made by Thomson ( Motorola ). frernaily they consist of two
processor units, one being the controlling part the other dedicated to monitor.
The two processors will individually calculate the actuator command signal. In
case of discrepancy between the COM and the MON channels, output to the
actuator will be inhibited.

The ELAC’s provide output to control the Elevators, the Ailerons and the THS.
Feedback from the surface actuator are returned to the ELAC’s.

The three SEC’s are made by Sextant ( Intell ). Internally they also consist of one
COM and one MON processor. The SEC’s provide output control to the Spoilers
and will be back-up for control of the Elevators and the THS. The SEC’s will also
receive position feedback from the control surfaces.

27-95-00 - FLIGHT CONTROL DAT.
Data Concentrators (FCDC) are installed in t
FCDC’s is to isolate as far as possible ,t
aircraft systemns.The FCDC receives an
such as:

The FCDC monitors and analy
power up, in flight and after touc
indications and deliver these information to the CFDIU on request. _
The FCDC commands also the illumination of the lights indicating the priority

between side sticks. But the side sticks priority logic is implemented inside the
ELAC and SEC.

The Flight Control Data Concentrators ( FCDC ) acquire data from the ELAC’s and
the SEC’s and transmit this to the ECAM and the CFDS. The FCDC also provide
access to the EFCS for CFDS tests.

The accelerometers are used for the pitch control law and the detection of LAF.
Automatic ”’power-up and "pressure-u p” tests of the EFCS are performed
without any surface movement.COM/MON construction :- ELACs and SECs consist
of 2 units completely segregated. Each unit acquires sensors/peripherals and
computes independently the servo control orders (Aileron, Spoiler and Elevator).
However, each units has a specific function:

e COM unit is in charge of the servo control COMMAND (computed order is sent

to the servo control).
e MON unit is in charge of the servo control MONITORING (computed order is not

sent to the servo control but is used to check the servo control movement and
servoing achieved by COM unit).

> Elevator or Aileron Damping Test
Servo control in the active mode:- the mode selector valve in the active position.
The two chambers of the piston are thus connected to the servo valve control
lines. Servo control in the damping mode:-the mode selector valve in the damping
position. This causes the two chambers of the piston to be interconnected through
the damping orifice. The damping orifice is calibrated to provide an appropriate
damping coefficient for the actuator.
Reason for the Job: To make sure that the damping coefficient of the servo
controls is sufficient. The alm of the damping test is to detect potential hidden
failures leading to decrease the damping coefficient of the actuator, i.e. all the
actuator failures (internal hydraulic leak) that would allow the hydraulic fluid to
communicate between the two chambers of the piston through a different way
from the damping orifice. For instance, piston dynamic head seal leakage.
If the damping coefficient is below the minimum value, do the related trouble

Fuel Quantity Indicating (FQI) system measures the quantity of fuel in the aircraft
fuel tanks. The FQ! system gives fuel quantity indications for each of these fuel
tanks:- the LH and RH wing tanks & the center tank. -

** ON A/C 001-007, 009-100, 201-300
A set of fuel probes are installed in each fuel tank. Each fuel probe has an
electrical capacitance value which changes in relation to the change in depth of
the fuel in its tank. The FQIC regularly measures the electrical capacitance values
of all the fuel probes. It then uses each set of probe capacitance values to find the
volume of fuel in a tank.

 

 
The fuel probes 22QT1(22QT2) and 33QT1(33QT2) have diodes that are used to

calculate the temperature of the fuel adjacent to them. The FQIC regularly

monitors these diodes and uses the voltage drop across them

to calculate the fuel temperature. The fuel temperature for each wing tank cell is
shown on the System Display (SD) FUEL page of the ECAM.

** ON A/C 101-150

Aset of fuel probes is installed in each fuel tank. Each fuel probe has an electrical
capacitance value which changes in relation to the change in depth of the fuel in
its tank. The FQIC regularly measures the electrical capacitance values of all the
fuel probes. It then uses each set of probe capacitance values to find the volume
of fuel in a tank.

The fuel probe 92QT1(92QT2) and 93QT1(93QT2) includes a temperature sensor
at its lower end. The temperature sensor has an electrical resistive element, the
value of which is in relation to the temperature of the fuel adjacent to it. The FQIC
regularly monitors the temperature sensor and uses its resistance value to
calculate the fuel temperature. The fuel temperature for each wing tank is shown
on the System Display (SD) FUEL page of the ECAM.

The electrical capacitance-value of the probe changes in relation to the depth of
fuel in the tank. When the probe is dry, its capacitance value is low, but as fuel
moves up the probe, its capacitance value increases.

The FQIC continuously measures the capacitance value.

FQIC contains the Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) that lets it test and monitor:

- the Fuel Quantity Indicating System (FQIS)

- the Fuel Level Sensing System (FLSS) (Ref. AMM D/O 28-46-00-00) .

The FQIC does BITE test of the FQIS at aircraft power-up and then continuously
whilst the FQIC is energized. The FQIC does the BITE test of the FLSS at aircraft
power-up for the sensors that are fully in fuel_or fully out of fuel. For the sensors
that cannot be tested, the FQIC does the BITE test of these sensors when the

fuel is next at the correct level. The FLSS BITE test is only done when the aircraft is
on the ground.

All the FQIS failures are sent to the Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS).

The FQIC has two channels, channel 1 and channel 2. One channel is the master
channel and the other channel is the slave channel (the master channel is always
the primary channel). Channel 1 and channel 2 do the FQIS BITE, but the FLSS
BITE is only done by the master channel. The BITE test results can be found on the
FQIC STATUS and FLSS STATUS pages of the MCDU. The system uses FQI probes,
Compensator probes and Cadensicons within each tank to continuously measure
the quantity of usable fuel in that tank. All interfacing and calculations are
performed by the Fuel Quantity Indication Computer (FQIC).

osegat Fuel Quantity Indication Computer (FQIC) does the fuel mass
Baie Ns and controls the whole system by using various interfaces.

' ES:-A set of Capacitance probes in each tank sends a signal to the computer
in relation to the fuel level in the tank. There are 5 probes in the center

tank and 14 per wing tank. A single probe failure does not affect the system
indication. In each tank inner cell, fuel probe No. 2 and in each outer cell fuel

Probe No. 13 have diodes that give the fuel temperature to the FQIC for indication
on the ECAM system display.

CAPACITANCE INDEX COMPENSATOR:

Compensator (cic) is installed inside each tank such that under normal
Operational conditions it is always fully submerged in fuel and thus the
permittivity of the fuel can be determined. The Capacitance Index Compensator
has a capacitance in Proportion to the dielectric constant of the fuel. The
Capacitance value is a result of the density of the fuel between the plates. The
fuel density changes with temperature and type of fuel. In the case of cadensicons
failure, the fuel mass can be calculated from a density value as assumed

from the dielectric constant value.

-CADENSICONS:-The cadensicons give a signal to the computer in Proportion to
the density and the dielectric constant of the fuel held in each tank. The fuel mass
is calculated from this density value.

FLSCU:-The Fuel Level Sensing Control Units (FLSCU) are mainly used:-to shut the
related refuel valve when the high level is reached in each tank,

~ to start the BITE test of the high level sensors and their related circuits,

by using the TEST switch on the refuel/defuel control panel.

High-level sensors in each tank send a signal to the FQIC, via the FLSCU.

The test is started via the FQIC and the FLSCU. Sensor and system status is sent

from the FQIC to the CFDS.

-One probe with a Capacitance Index

OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLE:- The FAIS is a positive DC capacitive system. In such a
system the fuel probes (which are the sensors) operate as capacitors. The
dielectric of the capacitors is:

- fuel if a fuel probe is covered with fuel

- air if a fuel probe is not covered with fuel.

Each fuel probe operates as a variable capacitor with a capacitance value related
to the ratio of the fuel probe covered in air or fuel. This is because the
permittivity of the fuel is approximately two times that of air. Thus the fuel is a
component part of the electrical FQIS. If water (and/or other unwanted materials)
gets into a fuel-tank, it can cause problems. Example, it can cause a partial ora
complete short circuit between the two concentric tubes of the fuel probe.
Interval is proportional to the density of the adjacent fuel.

. It Is very important that the water In each fuel tank Is kept to a minimum. A
failure to do so can cause the problems that follow:

- water contamination

- microbiological contamination

- chemical contamination etc ,etc

In each tank the density of the fuel is measured by using a cadensicon, which
measures only its respective tank. The signals have a continuous 30 seconds time
average applied to remove fluctuations.

If the cadensicon signal is not available or invalid (all failed or out of

range in water) the Capacitance Index Capacitor (CIC) signal is used.

One probe has a CIC at its lower end. The CIC has a specific function:

- to measure the dielectric constant, because most of the time it is fully

covered by remaining fuel in tank.

The FQIC uses the dielectric constant to calculate the fuel volume in the

tanks. The electrical capacitance of each probe is proportional to the height of
fuel around the probe. One CIC probe is positioned in the tank (always

fully submerged in fuel under normal operational conditions) measuring

the permittivity of the fuel (K, also called the dielectric).

NOTE: The ECAM displays the Fuel on Board (FOB) with two amber

dashes as a degraded display, as long as the accuracy is not degraded beyond 5%.

The inter cell transfer system is controlled automatically by the FLSS and the
FQIC. When one of the two low level sensors 15QJ1/16QJ2) becomes dry, the
FLSCU1/2 will send an open signal to the two actuators 90P and 10QP. When one
of the two low level sensors 16QJ1/15QJ/2 becomes dry, the FLSCU1/2 will send an
Open signal to the two actuators 11QP and 12QP. When open the intercell
transfer valves stay latched open until the next refuel operation. At the start of a
refuel operation the inter cell transfer valve actuators are de-latched by the FQIC

If both intercell transfer valves in one tank fail to open when commanded:

— the Fuel Quantity Indication ( FQI ) for the related outer cell goes amber

in color and is shown boxed. This is to indicate that the fuel in outer cell
is unusable

— the Fuel On Board ( FOB ) indication on the SD FUEL page is shown amber
and boxed. This to indicate that the FOB is not fully usable.

Center Tank Pumps 1.0
The center tank pumps have two modes of operation:-manual or automatic
in manual mace ( MODE SEL P/B switch released out ), the operation of the pumps

 

is controlled by the CTR TK PUMPS P/B switches.
In automatic moce ( MODE SEL P/B switch pushed in ) the center tank pumps are
controlled by the Fuel Level Sensing Control Unit depend on, slats position, wing
and center tank low level sensors. If the CTR TK PUMPS P/B switches set to ON:-

During engine s
operate for two

 

rt, regardless of the slats position, the center tank pumps will
rinutes to scavenge any water in the tank before takeoff.

 

On ground, before takeoff, when slats are extended, the center tank pumps will
stop and the fuel will be supplied by the wing tank pumps.

During climb, when slats are retracted below 16 the center tank pumps will start
and the higher pressure will give priority to the center tank pumps.

The pumps will now operate untill center tank low level plus five minutes is
obtained. Fault inhibit relays do not let the FAULT annunciators come ON during the
five minute period.,

FUEL SENSOR FUNCTION:- All the sensors are similar.
High Level Sensors:-Installed near the top of each fuel tank. When the sensor
becomes wet the FLSCU signals the associated tank refuel solenoid valve to close,
and will illuminate the “HI LEVEL” light on the refuel panel.

Low Level Sensors:-in the center tank ( 130 kg ), when dry, they will signal the
center tank boost pump to stop, with a time delay of 5 minutes. In the wing tank
(750 kg ), when dry, they will open LH and RH Transfer valves simultaneously. If
the sensor is exposed to air for more than 30 seconds, “FUEL LO LEVEL” warning

will be indicated on the ECAM display.

IDG Low Level Sensors:- will stop IDG fuel return when the fuel level is below
280kg.

Full Level Sensors:-in the left and right inner cells, controls the operation of the
center tank pumps when ”AUTO” is selected. They will stop the center tank pumps
when covered in fuel.

Under full Level Sensors:- in left and right inner cells, controls the operation of
the center tank pumps when ”AUTO” is selected. When dry the center tank pumps
start again if there is no low level in the center tank. The difference between full /
under full is approximately 500kg.

Overflow Level Sensor:- in the Vent Surge tanks, will signal the respective IDG fuel
return valve to close.

Temperature Sensors:- inner cell (52.5 C) and/or outer cell (55 C) will signal the
respective IDG fuel return valve to close if the specified temperature is exceeded. .

—~3 - How to read the input parameter tables for A320 aircraft:-

(1) To get the FQIC input parameter table follow the instructions as detailed in
AMM 28-42-00-740-003 - Interrogation of the FAIS Input Parameters Pages

(2) Print out the Fals discrete input Parameters, and make a note of the Individual
fuel tank FQI

(3) Use information above confirm the status of the Level Sensor - Determine
whether the Level Sensors should be WET (or NOT DRY) or DRY (or NOT WET}

(4) Use information in the TSM, ch 28-42-00 P Block 301(Also refer to TSM task
TSM TASK 28-46-00-810-818), to identify the locations on the FAIS input
parameters of the individual level sensors e.g. Location 4P 16QU2 WET (LS5/i}
(5) Confirm the status of the level sensor as seen by the FQIS input parameter.
The status of the level sensors, when indicating "1" are as follows:LS7

FLSCU2 6QJ - DRY — Dummy Sensor

NOTE 1: Default value is "0". For High level sensor sensors default values is PO")
which is WET. The high level sensors will not be powered until the refuel panel is
open, Unless these conditions are met the input parameters will indicate that the

high level sensors are WET.
NOTE 2: The High Level sensors will be de powered, and show "WET" Status if

refuel panel is not open

PTU INHIBITED:-The PTU operation is inhibited:-(a) During cargo door operation,
(b) If the PTU P/B is switched OFF, (c) When the A/C is on ground, with one engine
running and (d) if the parking brake is set on or the nose wheel steering is
disconnected for towing (example: First engine start up during push back).
In flight, if the PTU is not able to pressurize a hydraulic failed system (G SYS LO PR
or Y SYS LO PR) within 6 seconds, either due to external leakage or PTU failure, the
PTU is automatically inhibited. This PTU inhibition logic is activated if both engines
are running and remains activated as long as one engine is running. The 20s relay
has been installed for the deactivation of the PTU inhibition logic. Once the PTU
has been automatically inhibited, the logic is "de-latched" and PTU no longer
inhibited 20 seconds after one of the following are met:- (a)A/C on ground OR,
-(b)Both engines stopped,
-(c))affected hydraulic system does not longer detect a low-pressure condition.
The FAULT light of the PTU P/BSW comes on when the sensors in the hydraulic
systems detect one of these conditions:
. Low fluid contents in the reservoir (Green or Yellow systems)
- Low air pressure in the reservoir (Green or Yellow systems)
: Fluid temperature too high (Green or Yellow systems).
The FWC also does a check of the PTU during the start of the engines. When the
master switch of the engine 1 (2) is ON and the master switch of the engine 2 (1)
is OFF, the PTU cannot operate if: (a) The yellow electric pump is in operation to
close the cargo doors.
or::(b) The aircraft is on the ground, only one engine is in operation and the
parking brake is ON or (c) The aircraft is on the ground, only one engine is in
operation and a towing arm is attached (NWS DISC is ON) or:- (d) PTU P/BSW on
the panel 40VU is set to OFF. ;
When the master switches of engine 1 and engine 2 are in the ON position, the
PTU can operate. If there is a difference between the Green and Yellow hydraulic
systems of more than 650 psi for more than 4 seconds, the ECAM shows a PTU
FAULT indication. .

EXTERNAL LEAKS & CAVITATION CONDITION
Check External Leaks of Hydraulic Components= AMM-29-00-00-790-001-A
To make sure that, external leaks, leakage and stains of the hydraulic
components are in the specified limits.
NOTE: The definitions of the terms used in this procedure are:-A leak is the
quantity of fluid that comes out of a component that is sufficient to become a
drop or drops, or will possibly become a drop (approximately 20 drops = 1cc,
75600 drops = 1 gallon)
If you do the check of external leaks because a complete loss of the hydraulic
system has occurred and the:-
- RSVR LO LVL warning on the upper ECAM DU of related hydraulic system is ON
> Engine driven pump Is operated for more than 5 minutes.
(a) You must do the check of the Green and/or Yellow hydraulic system after
operation in a possible of the engine pump ( AMMETASK 29-00-00-280-006)
TASK 29-00-00-280-006-A
Check of the Green or Yellow Hydraulic System after Engine Pump Failure or
Operation ina Possible Cavitation Condition - with Ground Cart Available
NOTE: A cavitation condition of the engine pump is possible when the engine
pump operates with the engine pump fire-valve closed (if you set the ENG 1 (2)
FIRE P/BSW on the Eng/APU fire panel), or with no fluid in the reservoir (ECAM
HYD system page). This procedure can also apply if there is a indication of
particles (from a defective EDP) released in the system (e.g. indication found
during trouble shooting or while examine pump low pressure or overheat).
Do a check of the engine pumps for a possible cavitation condition
NOTE:- Two procedures are included here to do a check after an engine pump
operation for more than 10 minutes in a possible cavitation condition. Each
procedure is applicable for a different set of conditions
Only do the procedure that is applicable for the conditions you find.
Do the subsequent procedure if the engine pump has operated for more than
10 minutes:- |
- With a closed engine pump fire valve, or With no fluid in the reservoir (ECAM
HYD system page) or RSVR LO LVL warning on the upper ECAM DU and unknown
fluid level.
NOTE: There are no time limits if The engine pump is set to OFF (ENG 1 (2) PUMP
FAULT/OFF P/BSW on panel 40VU), with The engine-pump fire valve open and
there is fluid in the reservoir. Do the subsequent procedure, after an engine
pump operation for more than 10 minutes:- With an open engine pump fire-
valve, and With fluid in the reservoir (index above the minimum gage able level

* the hydraulic reservoirs. If the pressure in one or more of the reservoirs is too low,

 

If the low level switch does not operate, the SDA“ uses the data from the
contents transmitter to start low level warning procedure. The warning is
generated when the trans er data show that the contents are below the

low level switch threshold. The SDAC makes the warnings occur when the
content of the reservoirs are .5 | (Green And Yellow reservoirs) or

reservoir). In this case, there will be no FSU"! indication on the overhead panel.

The pressure switches (1074GK, 2074GJ and 3074GD) downstream of the engine
pumps and downstream of the Blue electric pump monitor the output of the
pumps.
The pressure switches (1151GN, 2151GN, 31S51GN) on the HP manifolds of the
three systems monitor the pressure in the systems. When the pressure is above
the low pressure warning threshold 1450 psi the switch sends a signal to the flight
control system. The Green and Yellow system switches also send signals to the
auto flight system. Green system switch also sends a signal to the brake system.
29-33-00 - HYDRAULIC FLUID TEMPERATURE INDICATING
The temperature transmitters monitor the temperature of the hydraulic fluid in
the return line. When the temperature of the fluid gets to 92.8 deg.c the
temperature transducers send an analog signal and the "OVHT" legend on the
system display of the ECAM comes on in amber. When the temperature of the
fluid goes higher than 95 deg.C the temperature switch in the transmitter closes. A
discrete signal then goes through the SDAC and the FWC to the overhead panel.
29-34 - RESERVOIR PRESSURIZATION INDICATING
The reservoir pressurization indicating system monitors the internal pressure of

the indicating system gives signals. The three reservoir air pressure-switches are
the same and they are interchangeable.
The contacts of the pressure switch close when the pressure decreases to
absolute (37psia) (relative (22 psig)). The contacts open when the pressure
increases to absolute (40 psia)

> SYS. MONITORING & INDICATION
SYSTEM PRESSURE MONITOR:- Pressure switches (1151GN, 2151GN, 3151GN )
on the HP manifolds of the three systems monitor the pressure in the systems.
When the pressure is above the low pressure warning threshold 1450 psi the
switch sends a signal to the flight control system. The Blue and Yellow system
switches also send signals to the auto flight system. The Green system switch
also sends a signal to the brake system. When the pressure in the system falls
below 1450 psi), the pressure switch operates and stops the signals to the flight

controls ( and auto flight / brake systems ). At the same time the switch sends a
signal to the FWC which give warnings.

function is to avoid depleting the brake accumulator too quickly when the

hydraulic power (green and yellow) is not available and the brake pedals are
used.When the green and yellow hydraulic powers are not available, the braking
system is in emergency mode and the hydraulic power Is supplied by the brake
accumulator. If the brake pedals are cycled in that configuration it will lead to
empty the brake accumulator.

In order to minimize the loss of hydraulic volume in the brake emptying/refilling
operation the ABCU continues to signal the alternate brake selector valve 99GG
Open and to energize the direct drive valve to keep the demanded pressure
equal to the Zero Torque Pressure even if the pedals are fully released.

This ZTP mode is activated when the aircraft is on ground, the pedals are
released, the green and yellow hydraulic powers are unavailable, the parking
brake is OFF and the towing signal on the NLG electrical box 5GC is not present.
If any of these conditions disappears then the ZTP mode is over.
The brake pressure transducers 100GG and 101GG are sending the brake
Pressure indication from the alternate braking system to the ABCU 95GG and the
BSCU 10GG but they are also the ones sending the information to the Triple
Pressure Indicator 60GG. As a consequence, the triple indicator wil! always
indicate a 240 psi pressure when the ZTP mode is activated.

Monitoring:-The PHC monitors heating of the static probes, AOA sensor, pitot
probes and TAT sensor. Current detection with a preset threshold is provided for
monitoring purposes,

Low heating or overcurrent or heating loss or discrepancy between the gr ounc!
and flight information sent by the | GCiUs triggers a warning.

Monitoring of the TAT sensors is inhibited on the ground.

A monitoring system activates a warning when heating is incorrect.

NOTE: - The PHC 1 controls the Captain and left systems. - The PH 2 controls the
First Officer and right systems. - The PHC 3 controls the Standby systems.

WHC:-There are two WHCs:

- one for the right side identified WHC2,

- one for the left side identified WHC1.

When the A/C is on ground, engines running, the LGCIUs send "ground"

signal to WHC, which sends “low level heating" for the windshield.
Temperature regulation, overheat protection and fault indication are given

by each WHC. In case of a windshield or window heating fault, the WHC

sends an output signal to the ECAM via the System Data Acquisition
Concentrator (SDAC). The WHCs also transmit fault messages to the

Centralized Fault Display Interface Unit (CFDIU).
CAUTION:-Pulling the Engine Interface Unit (EIU) power supply C/Bs

causes the unwanted heating of the windshield and the side windows

CAUTION FOR LGCIU C/B OPENED:-If you have to pull the Landing Gear Control
and Interface Unit (LGCIU) power supply C/Bs or before you lift the aircraft on
jacks you have to accomplish the Flight Configuration Precautions, this prevents
unwanted heating of the windshield and side windows..
CAUTION FOR EIU C/B OPENED:-If you have to pull the EIU power supply C/Bs, the

related engine OIL LOW PRESS and GND RLYs are de-energized, this will cause

windshield and windows to be heated.

EIS-ECAM:- Electronic Instrument System (EIS)
The Electronic Instrument System (EIS) is shown on 6 identical Liquid
Crystal Display (LCD) units and controlled through the EIS control
panels. The Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) displays
are identical and controlled through the ECAM Control Panel (ECP).
The Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) displays are controlled
by the EFIS control panels and the lighting/loudspeaker control panels.

DMC:-The Display Management Computers (DMCs) are data concentrators and
receive data from aircraft sensors and systems. They send them to the Display
Units (DUs). The DUs compute and display the images on each unit.

In normal operation DMC1 drives the CAPT Primary Flight Display (PFD), the CAPT
Navigation Display (ND), Engine/Warning Display (EWD) and System Display (SD).
In normal operation DMC 2 drives the F/O PFD and ND DUs.

\f DMC 1 fails, it is automatically replaced by DMC 2 for ECAM only.

DMC 2 cannot drive the CAPT PFD and ND; a manual switching to DMC 3 is
required. DMC 3 can drive any of the six DUs. DMC 3 is a hot spare awaiting the
failure of DMC 1 or 2 and can be switched to drive the DUs linked to the failed

DMC. Data loading of the DMC 1 is possible with Portable Data Loader (PDL).
The 3 DMCs are identical and interchangeable.

FWC:-The Flight Warning Computers (FWCs) monitor the aircraft systems. Each
FWC generates all warning and caution messages, supplies the attention getters,
computes the flight phase and provides aural warnings.

SDAC:-The System Data Acquisition Concentrators (SDACs) receive various signals
from the aircraft systems and send them to the FWCs and to the DMCs.

CENTRALIZED FAULT DISPLAY SYSTEM:-The CFDS is a centralized maintenance aid
system which gives the maintenance technicians a means to read the
maintenance information related to most of the aircraft systems and to initiate
the tests of these systems from the cockpit.

The CFDIU is connected to most of the electronic systems (BITE) of the aircraft
and stores failure information from these systems in memory.

It also serves to initialize tests in each system.

A320 family:-AMM TASK 31-36-00-740-008 — Access to the Parameter Call-Up
menus

- The Alpha Call-up list is accessible under AMM 31-36 or 31-37

- The EQ codes list is accessible under AMM 31-36 or 31-37

It is recommended to use the ACMS parameter callup functions intensively as
being an efficient means for system T/S.

The Braking/Steering Control Unit (BSCU) has two power supply units,

one for each systems. At each power up the system supplied first takes

the control. If both systems are powered up at the same time, system 1

has priority. ;

At each extension of the L/G, the system on command will go to standby and the
other system will take over the control. If there is a disagreement between the
control and the monitoring channels, the related system is disengaged and the
system in standby takes over.

BRAKE SYSTEM:-
SELECTOR VALVE:-The selector valve is an on/off valve. When normal braking is
applied, the BSCU first energizes the selector valve, this lets full green pressure
supply the normal servo valves.
NORMAL SERVOVALVES:-The normal servo valve has a dual function: it regulates
braking pressure, which depends on BSCU braking orders, and anti-skid contro!
Pressure delivered to the brakes. This servo valve with direct control laws is fully
closed when there is no braking order. They are located on the MLG strut.
ABCU:-The ABCU controls and monitors the alternate braking system with and
without anti-skid protection. The ABCU is automatically activated if:
- the anti-skid is faulty,
- the A/SKID switch is selected to OFF (BSCU OFF)
- the BSCU is not serviceable (both system 1 & 2 have failed),
- the normal braking has failed,

- the pressure downstream the selector valve drops below a given threshold,

- only the batteries supply the A/C.

LANDING GEAR PANEL:-A landing gear panel is composed of a toggle switch for
anti-skid and nose wheel steering function inhibition. There are also three P/BSWs

for AUTO-BRAKE selection. The BSCU and ABCU receive inputs from the landing
gear panel.

TRIPLE INDICATOR:-A triple indicator gives pressure indication. The top needle

supplies the alternate breaking accumulator supply pressure. The bottom needles

supply pressure (How much Press)sent to the left and right brakes units (indication
available only if ALTERNATE BRAKING is active or PARKING BRAKE is set to on).
WHEELS:-Each main wheel has multidisc carbon b

rakes. Each main wheel rotation
speed given by a tachometer is sent to the BSCU for anti-skid computation.
SHUTTLE VALVES:-The shuttle valves give the hydraulic Priority for brake supply to
the parking brake.
PARKING BRAKE CONTROL VALVE:
Operated by the parking brake han
and the ABCU in order to override all other braking modes.

If the normal braking system is available and, if the Pedals are depressed when the
PARK BRK is ON and the Pressure commande

ene as vn the different phases of flight, the BSCU automatically triggers the
lene =(a) Ower-up test, (b)Permanent test,(c)Functional test: in flight with the
‘atk Ng Bear extended until touchdown of the main gear,
4 y achometer test:-rolling without brake application, (e) Permanent monitoring:
uring operation of the braking or steering system.
Power-up Test:-The BSCU has two types of reset: long reset; short reset
Long reset:-The conditions for triggering a long reset are :
- detection of energization subsequent to a 115V/400 Hz cut lasting 5 seconds or

more, or Switching of the A/SKID & NOSE WHEEL switch from OFF to ON
‘and aircraft condition in STOP phase.

The STOP phase corresponds to:-
shut down&: wheels at stop.

Short reset:- The conditions for triggering a short reset are :detection of
energization subsequent to a 115V/400 Hz cut lasting less than
2 seconds or a 115V/400 Hz cut lasting more than 5 seconds out of the
STOP phase or switching of the A/SKID & NOSE WHEEL switch from OFF to ON out
= the STOP phase or an auto-reset_or return Power supply monitoring to OK.
eration of the Functional Test:-The functional test starts as soon as the gears
are locked down. Its purpose is to do the test of the hydraulic equipment under
Pressure and the electronic control components of the selected BSCU system.
It also monitors the availability of the automatic braking and of the nosewheel
steering systems until the touchdown.
This is to meet the safety requirements of a CAT III B landing.
For this purpose, the BSCU sends four availability discretes to the two FMGCs.
The functional tests are performed by a single system (SYS1 or SYS2), selected by
the BSCU. At each flight, the BSCU changes the system performing the tests.
The functional test has three parts, running on the active system:
(a) THE FUNCTIONAL TEST OF THE NORMAL BRAKING SYSTEM:- The functional
test of the normal braking system consists in sending successive brake application/
release orders on the NORMAL system. These tests are in five successive
sequences.
(b) THE FUNCTIONAL TEST OF THE ALTERNATE BRAKING:- The functional test of
the alternate braking system consists in sending successive brake application/
release orders on the ALTERNATE system. These tests are in nine successive
sequences. "
(c) THE FUNCTIONAL TEST OF THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING SYSTEM:-. These tests
are performed after the normal braking functional tests. During these tests the
BSCU generates low amplitude reference angle signals and monitors the
nosewheel steering response.

These tests are in five successive sequences, the fifth sequence being performed
cyclically until the end of the test phase (Main Landing gear touch down).

Two types of tests are proposed:- This function is to be activated after any
maintenance action on the aircraft. Its purpose is to check correct operation of
the BSCU and its peripherals.

- LRU WIRING & BSCU TEST: this test launches the continuity electrical monitoring
and permanent monitoring functions

-NORMAL BRAKING TEST: this test launches the continuity electrical monitoring,
the permanent monitoring and the functional braking tests on the NORMAL
system. Once the test has been selected, the BSCU indicates the conditions
required to launch the test. Once these conditions have been met, you can launch
the test by pushing the line key adjacent to the START TEST indication.

During the test, the IN PROGRESS indication is displayed.

After the test, several response indications can be displayed:

+ NO FAULT DETECTED: test OK_OR ; Fault detected : test not OK, gives the Class 1
and Class 3 fault messages detected OR TEST NOT PERFORMED: at least one of the
conditions required is not fulfilled OR TEST TIME OUT.

SPECIFIC DATA:-This item has a front page showing four selections:

- To allow 7 full brake application in emergency mode (alternate braking

- Insufficient pre-charge pressure may cause the bladder to fold back on itself
and to wear out.

Typical damage are pin hole, longitudinal cut or friction wear.

Atoo high pre-charge pressure may result in the bladder to come into contact
with the internal valve and create arc-shape tear or strips on the bladder.

due to offset within the system:- ‘Residual’ steering order coming from handwheel f

RVDT 3GC adjustment.

NOTE:- A Nose Wheel Steering (NWS) angle of 0.5 degree (3 degrees rudder trim)
or less is permitted. If more than 3 degrees of rudder trim was necessary to keep
the aircraft straight during taxi, the cause could be due to side winds or runway
camber. To make sure that the problem with the NWS system was not caused by
external effects, it is necessary to let the aircraft return to service (after having
done same checks) and monitor the aircraft at the next taxi operation. But, when
there are 3, or more, aircraft log book entries in the last 10 flights this is an
indication that there is a fault in the NWS system.

AIR DATA/INERTIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM (ADIRS)

The Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU) comprises an Air Data
Reference (ADR) system and an Inertial Reference (IR) system, both
included in a single unit. The ADIRU uses inputs from external sensors:
Angle Of Attack (AOA), Total Air Temperature (TAT), and Air Data
Module (ADM). The ADIRUs are interfaced with the Air Data/Inertial
Reference System (ADIRS) Mode Selector Unit (MSU).

PITOT PROBES:-Three Pitot probes provide total pressure to three Air Data
Modules (ADMs), which convert this pressure into digital format: ARINC 429.
ARINC words are then sent to the corresponding Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit
(ADIRU).

STATIC PORTS:- Six static ports provide static pressure to five ADMs, which
convert this pressure into digital format: ARINC 429. The two standby static ports
provide an average pressure directly to the standby instruments, and to ADR 3
through a single ADM.

AOA SENSORS:-Each ADIRU receives Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) information from its
corresponding AOA sensor. The AOA sensors are also called Alpha probes.

TAT SENSORS:-The three ADIRUs receive Total Air Temperature (TAT) information
from two TAT sensors.
NOTE: The two TAT sensors are composed of two sensing elements.

ADIRU 3 receives the TAT from TAT sensor 1 one only.

NOTE:- There is no specific ADIRS battery.

WATER DRAIN:-The probes are installed in such a way that their pressure lines do
not require a water drain, except for that of the standby static ports.

MMR SYSTEM :-The Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) system is a navigation sensor
with 3 internal receivers: MMR = ILS + GPS.

MKR PRINCIPLE:-The MKR system is a radio navigation aid, which indicates the
distance between the aircraft and the runway threshold. The MKR system is
normally used together with the ILS system during an ILS approach..

ILS PRINCIPLE:-The function of the ILS is to supply to the crew and airborne system
users, signals transmitted by ground stations. A descent axis is determined by the
intersection of a Localizer beam (LOC) and a Glide Slope beam (G/S) created by
these ground stations at known frequencies. The ILS can measure and display
angular deviations and it also receives the Morse audio signal, which identifies the

ILS ground stations.

SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS

~~ PWS PRINCIPLE:-A wind shear event is a sudden change of wind speed and/or

” direction over a small distance caused by downwards and/or upwards movement
of the air. The most critical moment for the aircraft is near the ground

: level during the approach or in take-off. The PWS function detects the

os wind shear event if measurable precipitation occurs during the event.

Note: :-To avoid radiating danger, and nuisance aural alerts the WINDSHEAR

AUTO/OFF selector switch must be selected OFF independently of the radar

34-42-00 - RADIO ALTIMETER
The Radio Altimeter (RA) system calculates the height of the aircraft
above the terrain during initial climb, approach and landing phases. The
RA can therefore operate over non-flat ground surface. The principle of
the RA is to transmit a frequency-modulated signal, from the aircraft to
the ground, and to receive the ground reflected signal after a certain delay.
The time between the transmission and the reception of the RA signal is
proportional to the A/C height.
ARINC TEST:-The RA ARINC TEST function can be activated by pressing the line key
adjacent to the corresponding indication on the RA maintenance sub-menu or by
. pressing the pushbutton switch on the face of the transceiver. - or until the
pushbutton switch on the face of the transceiver is released.
RAMP TEST:-The RAMP TEST function from the MCDU by pressing the line key
adjacent to the SYSTEM REPORT/TEST indication on the CFDS menu then selecting
the RA1 (RAZ) on the NAV menu and then selecting the RAMP TEST page.The RA
then begins simulating a ramp starting from 500 ft. down to 0 ft. (with a slope of
10 ft/s from 500 ft. to 50 ft. and approximately 3 ft/s from 50 ft. to 0 ft.).
SYSTEM TEST:-The RA SYSTEM TEST function can be activated by pressing the line
key adjacent to the corresponding indication on the RA 1(2) maintenance sub-
menu. The following sequence occurs : ‘
- on the PFD :- the bottom sector line moves down from the horizon line.
the radio altimeter is 40 ft. .
on the MCDU, at the end of the test, the TEST OK message comes into view.
NOTE: If the system test or the ramp test cannot be initiated on ground from the
MCDU (which means that a fault affects either the LGCIU, the EIU or the RA) a
TEST page comes into view on the MCDU.

34-43-00 - TRAFFIC COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM (TCAS)
The Terrain and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (T2CAS) is a combination of
two functions ina single Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). These functions are the
TCAS (TCAS Il Change 7) and the Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS).
General purpose of the T2CAS is to alert the crew of two kinds of hazards which
are:-(a) Collision with terrain (Controlled Flight Into Terrain ).
(B) Collision with surrounding traffic.
ATC/Mode S$ transponders:-Two ATC/Mode S transponders, one active and the
other on standby, are used with their antennas. Each transponder is linked to the
TCAS by one high-speed ARINC 429 bus for transmission and another one for
reception,
Measurement of Intruder Parameters:- Determination of relative altitude Upon
confirmed transponder reception, the TCAS starts to interrogate the intruder. Its
altitude is transmitted directly in the reply (standard barometric altitude) and this
information is used to determine the relative altitude of the two aircraft, by
calculating the barometric altitude difference. This computation is, however, only
possible with respect to Mode C or Mode S transponder equipped aircraft.
COMPONENTS:-The TCAS (or T2CAS) components are two antennas, one TCAS II

> 34-52-00 - ATC/MODE S$ (SELECT)
The Air Traffic Cantrol (ATC) system is based on the replies provided by the
airborne transponders in response to interrogations from the ATC Secondary
Surveillance Radar (SSR).
The ground ATC secondary radar uses technics which provide the air traffic
control with information thaS be acquired by the primary radar. This system
serves to distinguish between aircraft and to maintain effective ground
surveillance of the air traffic.
The system provides the air traffic controllers with :
- Mode A: transmission of aircraft identification (code number)
: Mode C: transmission of aircraft barometric altitude
‘ Mode S: selective calling.
The ATC/Mode S transponder receives interrogations from:
. Mode S and SSR ground stations
. TCAS-equipped aircraft (the Mode S transponder transmits TCAS data from
another TCAS-equipped aircraft to its own TCAS computer).
Each (ATC Mode S-equipped) aircraft has its own Mode S address. This address
(24-bit) is included in all Mode S transmissions, so that every interrogation can be

 

computer (or T2CAS computer) and one TCAS/ATC control panel.
34-72-00 The Traffic and Terrain Integrated Surveillance System (T/TISS) is a
combination of three functions in a single Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). These
functions are Traffic alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) (TCAS II Change
7.1) with Airborne Traffic Situation Awareness (ATSAW) capability , Terrain
Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) and ATC/Mode S transponder.

The T/TISS:-_Provides Mode S transponder functions, including Elementary
Surveillance (ELS), Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) and Automatic Dependant
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B OUT).

The full configuration contains a single T/TISS (using its own pair of antennas, for
both TCAS and embedded transponder) and a standalone legacy transponder
(using its own pair of antennas).

34-51-00 — DME
DME SYSTEM PRINCIPLE:-The Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) provides
digital readout of the aircraft slant range distance from a selected ground station.
The system generates interrogation pulses from an onboard interrogator and
sends them to a selected ground station. After a 50 microseconds delay, the
ground station replies. The interrogator determines the distance in nautical
miles between the station and the aircraft. The interrogator detects the
Morse audio signal, which identifies the ground station.
The components are two antennas and two interrogators.

ADF SYSTEM PRINCIPLE:-The ADF is a radio navigation aid. It provides:
- the relative bearing of the aircraft to a selected ground station called
Non-Directional Beacon (NDB),:-an aural identification of the ground station.
The relative bearing is the angle between the aircraft heading and the
aircraft/ground station axis. The combination of signals, received from
two loop antennas and from one omni-directional sense antenna, provides
bearing information. An additional Morse signal is provided to identify the
selected ground station
34-55-00 — VOR/MARKER

VOR/MKR SYSTEM PRINCIPLE:-The VOR system is a medium-range radio
navigation aid. The VOR system receives, decodes and processes bearing
information from the omni-directional ground station, working in the frequency
range of 108 MHz to 117.95 MHz. The ground VOR station generates a reference
phase signal and a variable phase signal. The phase difference between

these signals, called bearing, is function of the aircraft position with

respect to the ground station. The bearing is the angle between the

magnetic north and the ground station/aircraft axis. Furthermore, the

VOR station provides a Morse identification, which identifies the station.

** ON A/C 101-150
Air is generally bled from an Intermediate Pressure (IP) stage of the engine High
Pressure (HP) compressor to minimize engine pressure losses. This is the normal
engine air-bleed configuration.
- The IP stage is the 3th HP compressor stage. At low engine speeds, when the
pressure from the IP stage is insufficient, air is automatically bled from a higher
compressor stage (HP stage). This happens especially at some aircraft holding
points and during descent, with engines at idle. - ;
- The HP stage is the 8th HP compressor stage. Transfer of bleed air is achieved by
means of a pneumatically operated and electrically commanded butterfly valve,
designated HP bleed valve (4000HA).
When the HP bleed valve is closed, air is directly bled from the IP stage through an
IP bleed check valve.

PNEUMATIC LEAK DETECTION: DETECTION LOGIC:- Both Bleed Monitoring
Computers (BMCs) permanently receive signals from the leak detection loops
Primarily tested at power-up. They exchange data via an ARINC bus for the
double loop detection. Each BMC channel A normally controls its side engine bleed
air system, so monitors the Over Heat Detection System (OHDS)..

The ENG BLEED FAULT light comes on when a leak is detected by the

wing loops A and B or by the pylon loops A and B. The APU BLEED

FAULT light comes on when an APU duct leak is detected.

When an overheat condition is detected by both loops, the following

alerts are generated for the affected zone:

- AIR ENG 1(2) LEAK for a leak/overheat detected in the Pylons,
- AIR L(R) WING LEAK for a leak/overheat detected in the Wings,
- AIR APU LEAK for a leak/overheat detected in the APU line,

- AIR APU LEAK [APU LEAK FED BY ENG] for a leak/overheat

detected in the APU line and the leak is automatically isolated.

A new warning alert has been introduced on the A320neo, the

AIR BLEED LEAK to isolate a bleed leak in the opposite pylon to the

operative bleed with manually open Cross bleed Valve. The failure of a single
loop for Pylon or Wing is identified by a MAINTENANCE message displayed on the
STATUS SD page. Dual engine loop failure is identified by the

| AIR ENG 1(2) LEAK DET FAULT and is NO GO.

If one BMC is failed, the other BMC takes over monitoring of the bleed

system and triggers the ECAM warnings.

Air is generally bled from an Intermediate Pressure (IP) stage of the engine High
Pressure (HP) compressor to minimize engine pressure losses. This is the normal
engine air-bleed configuration.

: The IP stage is the 5th HP compressor stage. At low engine speeds, when the
pressure from the IP stage is insufficient, air is automatically bled from a higher
compressor stage (HP stage). This happens especially at some aircraft holding
points and during descent, with engines at idle.

- The HP stage is the 9th HP compressor stage. Transfer of air bleed is achieved by
means of a pneumatically operated butterfly valve, designated HP bleed valve.
Two pressure transducers are installed on a bracket adjacent to the precooler
exchanger. One pressure transducer (7HA) is connected with a sense line to the
pneumatic duct downstream of the HP bleed valve , the other (SHA) is connected
with a sense line to the pneumatic duct downstream of the PRV.. Both pressure
transducers are connected to the bleed air monitoring computers (BMC)

by an electrical cable.

*During engine motor-to-start: - If a steady stream of fuel is observed coming
from the overboard vent in the drain mast, the engine should be shut down and
restart. If a steady stream of fuel is observed during the next motor-to-start,
replace the ecology tank. — If fuel leakage is less than or equal to ten
drops/minute, proceed to idle. *Engine at idle: -If a steady stream of fuel is
observed coming fram the overboard vent in the drain mast after one minute at
idle, the engine should be shut down and restart. If a steady stream of fuel is
observed during the next run to idle, replace the ecology tank. - A fuel leakage
rate of five drops per minute at idle is acceptable and no maintenance action is
required.

*after Shutdown: - After engine shutdown, the ecology system may overfill and
result in overboard leakage out the drain mast. A fuel leakage rate of five drops
per minute is acceptable under these conditions and no maintenance action is
required. If leakage exceeds five drops/min, draining the ecology tank.

these maximum values is also displayed. Both indicated and physical 1 and £6"
values are displayed. There is no separate indicated value for 2. These maxim
values and the duration of any limit exceedance are reset during engine ground
start, or they may be reset by an option in menu mode. When the reset option is
selected by the operator, a confirmation screen is displayed.

  
   
 

   

 

Engine vibration measurement consists of:
- 2 transducers (piezo-electric accelerometers).
- An Engine Vibration Monitoring Unit (EVMU).

- 2 vibration indications. ;
The No 1 bearing vibration sensor permanently monitors vibrations from the No 1

bearing. It also senses vibrations in the LPT and HPT shafts. This sensor is also used
for trim balance operations.

The Turbine Rear Frame (TRF) vibration sensor is used in conjunction with the No
1 bearing vibration sensor to monitor and, if necessary, reduce engine vibration
levels using the trim balance procedure.

The EVMU computes the position and the amplitude of the unbalance and is
capable of on-board fan trim balancing.

The ECAM receives information via SDAC1 and SDAC2.

The vibration indications are displayed in green on the lower ECAM display, in the
engine and cruise pages. The maximum value that can be displayed is 10 units.

- 10 units for the N1 rotor corresponds to 10 MILS (/V/LS = Milli-Inch).

- 10 units for the N2 rotor corresponds to 4 IPS (IPS = Inch per second).

DATA SYSTEM (AIDS)

 
Flight Data Interface and Management Unit ( FDIMU)

The Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) combines two
functions which operate independently from each other: the Flight Data
Interface Unit (FDIU) and the Data Management Unit (DMU). An internal
data-bus connects the two parts. The Data Management Unit

(DMU) processes up to 23 different types of report:-

Standard reports described in this AMM 31-37 are adapted to the specific A/C
recording configuration.

-AMM 31-37-21 provides with complete description of ECS reports
-AMM 31-37-49 provides with complete description of APU reports
-AMM 31-37-51 provides with complete description of Structure reports
-AMM 31-37-73 provides with complete description of Engine reports

To each individual report, a set of trigger code has been assigned and designed for
a specific purpose:

- code 1000 corresponds to a manual report generation where report is manually
triggered by an operator from the cockpit through the MCDU AIDS menu,

- code 2000 corresponds to a manual report generation where the report is
triggered by means of the remote print button (RPB) from the cockpit (flight phase
dependent),

- code 3xxx corresponds to programmable trigger codes where the user can
program its own trigger logic conditions (through the DMU/FDIMU ground
programming tool),

- codes 4xxx to 7xxxx correspond to automatic report generations according to
the predefined trigger conditions. The trigger code number is particularly used to
clearly identify the source and reason of the trigger like:- Referring example as:-

EGT = 3877 should actually be read EGT = 387.7 deg C (positive values using the
first position digit)

N1 = 0802 should be read N1 = 80.2 % rpm

Please find enclosed herewith detailed EGT and N1, N2 parameter descriptions:
EGT readout (X999 format): - for positive EGT values : EGT = 9999 in the report
means 999.9 deg C (first position is used for the value) - for negative EGT values:
EGT = N999 in the report means -99.9 deg C (the negative value is indicated by
N in the first position) [EGT op. range -80 to 999.9 °C]

N1,N2 readout (9999 format):-N1,N2 = 9999 in the report must be read 999.9 %
tpm [N1,N2 op. range 0 to 120.0 % rpm]

BLEED STATUS:-Bleed status is indicated with discrete coded information and
numerical values. In the discrete coded information, 0 indicates that the valve is
closed and 1 indicates that the valve is open.
A320 family aircraft:-Equipment providing the function:
ACMS Engine Cruise report <01> code 4000 As described in
Engine Cruise report <01> has two logic for the observing of en
during Cruise:-
- one based on Flight Hours.&- one based on Flight Legs.
At entry into AIDS Cruise phase, when observation is launched, the DMU starts to
look for the "Stable Frame Condition" to be met in order to compute code 5000
reports. report with the best quality factor QE for the whole flight will then be
kept into memory.
However, if after a certain time (‘Y01.2' minutes = 10 min by default), the stability
criteria is not met, a report code 4000 will be generated with the following
message "NO STABLE FRAME CONDITION”.

- For CFM / PW engines, the "Stable Frame Condition" is met when the HPT
parameter (‘Selected High Pressure Turbine Clearance Position' from ECU / EEC on
label 306) is between 'HPTL1'= 70% and 'HPTL2'=105% (example given for CFM56-
5-B4 Engines, if not customized) and if the variation of the following parameters
stays inside a set of tolerances during 'PO1'=100s

(if not customized): IALT, GS, ROLL ANGLE, TAT, N2, EGT, VACC, MN, N1, PT2, HPT,
LPT.

ACMS Real Time monitoring:-Parameter Call-up Functions:-Alpha Call-up

- Parameter value is displayed in engineering unit (Deg, Ft, Kt, Lbs, etc.)

- Sets of alpha call ups can be stored for later recall or sent in real time to

the printer - Ability to display in real time via the MCDU, any digital data on the
aircraft that is available to the FDIMU/DMU.

(All ARINC 429 parameters from computers connected to ACMS can be

read) - Outputs: MCDU display, printer

Label Call-up:- Parameter value is displayed in binary form ACMS = ARINC429
Reader - Sets of label call ups can be stored for later recall or to be sent in real
time to the printer

- EQ.SYS.LAB.SDI data entry concept

- SSM readout

- Outputs: MCDU display, printer

- The Alpha Call-up list is accessible under AMM 31-36 or 31-37

- The EQ codes list is accessible under AMM 31-36 or 31-37

It is recommended to use the ACMS parameter callup functions intensively as
being an efficient means for system T/S. The following AMM tasks can be
consulted for this purpose:

LOAD REPORT <15>
The Load report is a collection of aircraft data before, at, and after an abnormal
Load condition either in the air or at touchdown.
Basically, this report is generated when excessive loads are applied to
the airframe during landing. The report mainly contains aircraft
aerodynamic data recorded before, at and after a hard landing. An aircraft
bounce can also be detected. In that case, additional data lines T1 to T4
are also generated. Report lines T1, T2, T3 and T4 are generated if the A/c
bounced and the appropriate logic conditions are true.

The environmental control system report is generated when there is a SC2 = Selected FWD Cabin Compt Temperature

malfunction in the air conditioning or pressurization system. The reason 2 og SC3 = Selected AFT Cabin Compt Temperature

for report generation is displayed (e.g. EXCESSIVE CABIN ALTITUDE). The report RV = Trim Air Pass Reg. Valve Status [1 = Closed]
contains engine, aircraft and environmental data. Basically, up to 19 sets of PCSW = Pressure Controller Status Word

parameters can be recorded at 15 seconds intervals before the event and 1 set at far om VSCB = Cabin V/s; PDC = Cabin Differential Pressure
the event. E.g.: Cabin altitude (ZCB) is observed for changes in each Vx line and a VF = Cabin Temperature Reg. Valve Position Group 1

causes the print out of one line when the change limit is exceeded (ie. VW = Cabin Temperature Reg. Valve Position Group 2
+/- 100 feet).

This report is a collection of data over a period of time in which the
“ag aircraft met the appropriate stability criteria. The required stability period
is 100 seconds (programmable value). Basically, whatever the number

| of times the stability is detected, only one report is generated per flight

Ee L mm leg. This report contains the data with the best engine quality number
(QE) over the whole flight leg. If no stability is detected, then a report is

generated with the following message in its last line:
-"NO STABLE FRAME CONDITION".

CRUISE PERFORMANCE REPORT <02>

ENGINE TAKE OFF REPORT <04> CFM

This report is generated while in the take off flight phase when the
sum of the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) for both engines is
maximum. It is used to check the trend and the stress of the engines
during take off. Basically, one report is generated per leg (programmable
frequency). The report mainly contains data of both engines, including the
maximum EGT (EGTM). The radio height (RALT), provided by

radio altimeters 1 and 2, is also printed.

Report is generated in the climb or cruise flight phases when, under stabilized
conditions, any of the following engine divergence conditions is detected:-

- Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) divergence exceeding a prog threshold,

- nacelle temperature (TN) divergence exceeding a programmed threshold.
The reason for divergence is displayed (EGT, TN). This report is intended

to detect quick degradation in engine performance. 3 sets of parameters

for both engines are recorded at 2 seconds intervals before the event,

1 set at the event and 3 sets at 2 seconds intervals after the event. In

addition, the following data is provided:

- E: Divergent engine (1 or 2),
- DIV: Absolute divergence value of EGT (or TN),
_ REF: Reference delta value of EGT (or TN). Actual delta EGT or delta TN ref value
