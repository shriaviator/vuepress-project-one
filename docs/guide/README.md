# Introduction

## A320 Family Aircrafts have No Fault Found Policy(NFF)

The aircraft is equipped with a high number of digital items of equipment . In most of the cases , computers may be recovered after a abnormal behaviour or a detected fault , either by a software reset(reset of the microprocessor) or by interrupting the power supply of its processing parts for a short time . This is achieved with the normal cockpit controls(engagement levers , pushbutton switches ), by selecting the related control off then on or by a action on the corresponding circuit breaker .

A320 Family maintenance concept is based on the use of the **Centralized Fault Display System (CFDS)** and the **Troubleshooting Manual (TSM)**

The Main purpose of the CFDS is to ease aircraft maintenance by compiling failure information from system BITE (Built in Test Equipment) and providing system BITE test capability from the cockpit

# Built-In Test Equipment

The CFDS also takes into account a major objective of the line maintenance which is to avoid unjustified removal of equipment .For these reasons the CFDS makes a detailed analysis to identify the responsible LRUs ; this is also to confirm that the event was actually due to a hardware failure and not a intermittent fault .To achieve its purpose ; the cfds has several major functions which supply a maintenance Post Flight Report (PFR) which is printed at the end of each flight .

# Failure classification and Indication :-
