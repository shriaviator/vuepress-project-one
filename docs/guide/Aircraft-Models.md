# Airbus Aircraft Designation

- A full, proper Airbus name would be, for example, the Airbus A320-231. This plane belongs to the A320 family, and the last three digits specify the plane even more.

- The first digit means that it was part of the Airbus A320-200 series â€” the second version of this plane. The last digits correspond to the type of engine used.
